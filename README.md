# Simple Ng2Redux with SystemJS Config

This repo was cloned from the Angular2 quickstart example:
https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/README.md

It's a trivial counter built with
[Ng2-Redux](https://npmjs.org/packages/ng2-redux); it's main purpose is to show
how to set up Ng2-Redux in a SystemJS/TypeScript/LiveServer environment.
